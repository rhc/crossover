# Crossover


This gem allows the following apps to work together:

1. A client app

- Reads 1024 bytes from /dev/urandom
- Cleans out all non UTF-8 compliant chars
- Replaces all spaces with asterix
- Sends this data to a server via TCPSocket

2. A server app

- Listens for any connections
- Accepts the data from the client app
- Prints it into a log file

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'crossover'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install crossover
